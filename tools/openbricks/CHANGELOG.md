# openbricks — host-tooling changelog

Versions the unified `openbricks` PyPI package (CLI + MuJoCo sim).
Firmware versions are tracked separately on the `v*` tag namespace.

## 0.10.1 — sdist build fix (no functional changes)

Fixes a build failure that prevented 0.10.0 from publishing:
`python -m build` runs `setup.py` inside an isolated environment
that can't reach `../../native/user_c_modules/openbricks/`. The
sdist now bundles the synced cores via `MANIFEST.in`, and
`_sync_cores()` falls through cleanly when the upstream isn't
available (sdist build context). Regression test in
`tests/test_sdist_build.py` builds a fresh sdist and asserts every
shared core is inside.

If you saw a 0.10.0 install fail, install 0.10.1 instead — it's the
same code, just shippable.

## 0.10.0 — unification

The host CLI (`openbricks-dev`) and the MuJoCo simulator
(`openbricks-sim`) are now a single `openbricks` PyPI package with
optional `[sim]` extra. One install, one console script, every
subcommand under `openbricks`.

### New install commands

```
pip install openbricks            # CLI only (lightweight)
pip install 'openbricks[sim]'     # CLI + MuJoCo physics
```

### Breaking changes

- **Console script renamed.** `openbricks-dev <subcmd>` →
  `openbricks <subcmd>`. The old binary is gone in 0.10.0.
- **Sim subcommand.** `openbricks-sim <subcmd>` → `openbricks sim
  <subcmd>`. Same arguments, dispatched via passthrough to the sim's
  CLI when the `[sim]` extra is installed.
- **PyPI distribution names.** Users on `openbricks-dev` and
  `openbricks-sim` should `pip uninstall openbricks-dev openbricks-sim`
  and `pip install 'openbricks[sim]'`.
- **Release-tag namespace.** `openbricks-dev/v*` → `openbricks/v*`.
  Firmware tags `v*` are unchanged.

### What did NOT change

- The Python module names: `openbricks_dev` and `openbricks_sim`
  stay as they are. The firmware-side `openbricks` package on the
  hub (drivers, robotics, native cores) is also imported on the host
  by the sim's driver shim — collapsing the host CLI's module name
  to `openbricks` would shadow it.
- Subcommand argument grammars: `flash` / `list` / `run` / `upload` /
  `stop` / `log` / `sim {preview,run}` accept the same flags as before.
- The codecov flag names (`openbricks-dev`, `openbricks-sim`) — the
  CI workflow uploads coverage under both flags from the unified job
  so the dashboard split stays meaningful.

### Migration guide

```bash
# Uninstall the legacy split packages.
pip uninstall openbricks-dev openbricks-sim

# Install the unified package. Drop the [sim] if you only need flash + run.
pip install 'openbricks[sim]'

# Update your shell aliases / scripts:
#   openbricks-dev flash …  →  openbricks flash …
#   openbricks-sim run …    →  openbricks sim run …
```

The legacy `openbricks-dev` PyPI project is frozen at 0.9.x — its
last release will carry a deprecation notice in the description. No
new versions will be published under that name.
